                  <p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you for your interest in joining us and working with me. I am building team in HKUST, specifically focusing on content restoration and content generation, and broadly on computer vision, machine learning, artificial intelligence.
                  I will post the new openings once funding is available. Please be sure to read the following information before contacting me.</p>

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">For sure, I will read every email, while may reply only to the ones with a good fit to the team. It will take time for me to respond, so you can send me an email again if there is no reply after days/weeks. Please do not send me the third email if there is no response.</p>

                  <teamtitle>My Support</teamtitle>
                 
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">I have always been engaged in supervising and mentoring students from top universities, and many of them are now very successful in the community (please check the <a href="https://whluo.github.io/assets/team.html" target="_blank">Team</a> page).
                  In general, my support includes academic supervision, financial security, computational resource, internship in high-tech companies (Tencent, Samsung, Kuaishou, etc.), visiting/exchanging opportunities in top universities (Cambridge, Oxford, Imperial, etc), and network connections.</p>
                  
                 


                  <teamtitle>For Ph.D. Students</teamtitle>
                  
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The position of Ph.D student is highly competitive due to limited funding source. We recurit self-motivated students to joining us. In general, every PhD student in my team is the "<a href="https://www.aboutamazon.eu/news/working-at-amazon/what-is-a-bar-raiser-at-amazon" target="_blank">Bar Raiser</a>" or "Bar Keeper" of the team. So the best
                  way is to check the profile of the existing PhD members in the team. Besides the <a href="https://fytgs.hkust.edu.hk/admissions/Admission-to-Hong-Kong-Campus/submitting-an-application/admission-requirements" target="_blank">English requirement</a> by the university, the candidates meeting the following criteria will have a good chance.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Strong coding skills, excellent academic performance, quick-learning ability
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    </li>

Exceptionally outstanding candidates will be nominated for the <a href="https://fytgs.hkust.edu.hk/scholarships/hong-kong-phd-fellowship-scheme" target="_blank">Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme/HKPFS</a> with 27,000+ HKD/month.</p>
